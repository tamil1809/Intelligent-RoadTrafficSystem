# Intelligent-RoadTrafficSystem🚥
Road traffic prediction using TensorFlow with ML.NET

The goal is to create a neural network that automate traffic signal system, multiple vehicles at huge traffic or certain time as fast as possible through dense highway traffic.

## Problem🛡

## DataSet🗄
**[DeepLab](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab)** is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image segmentation, where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g., person, dog, cat and so on) to every pixel in the input image. Some segmentation results on Flickr images:

In the driving context, we aim to obtain a semantic understanding of the Road driving scene throught the camera input. This is important for Changing traffic signals and an essential requirement for all levels of autonomous traffic change. The first step is to build the model and load the pre-trained weights. In this demo, we use the model checkpoint trained on **[Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/)** dataset.
